Welcome to InkMap, an application designed to not only inspire you to get your next tattoo, but also to show you where you can get it done. Find your inspiration with InkMap.

## Description

InkMap is a web application that brings artists and art into one domain. Upon first visiting our app, the user will be greeted by a beautiful splash screen. Once clicked through to the search page, the user is shown a default search to display images of tattoos, as well as the addresses for local tattoo shops (using the Foursquare API). Using the Unsplash API, a user can search for tattoo ideas and they will be dynamically rendered to the page.

_2021 UPDATE:_ This application has been rebuilt using React! Due to the cost associated with the Google Places API in previous versions, it has been substituted for the Foursquare API.
